## 🔍 Detailed Observations

### Positive Findings

1. **Idempotent Operations**

   - Scripts can be run multiple times safely
   - Existing resources are detected and handled properly

2. **Clear Progress Indication**

   - Color-coded output (green ✓, yellow →, blue headers)
   - Step-by-step progress messages
   - Clear section separation

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**

   - Prerequisites check prevents common issues
   - Health checks ensure services are actually ready
   - End-to-end test validates full system

4. **Production Ready**
   - Proper error handling
   - Clean shutdown process
   - Resource cleanup options

### Areas for Enhancement (Optional)

1. **Interactive Mode**

   - Add `--non-interactive` flag for CI/CD
   - Currently requires input for cleanup (handled with echo "n")

2. **Logging**

   - Consider adding log file output
   - Currently outputs to stdout only

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Add retry for transient network issues
   - Currently relies on manual re-run

**Note:** These are minor enhancements. Scripts are production-ready as-is.

# Test stop script
echo "n" | ./stop.sh

# Test start script
./start.sh

# Verify services
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/logs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"test","event_type":"test","payload":{}}'
```
