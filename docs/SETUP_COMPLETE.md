```

### 2. Test the API

#### Create a Test Log:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/logs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": "demo",
    "event_type": "test",
    "payload": {"message": "Hello World"}
  }'
```

#### Get All Logs:

## 📁 Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Fabric SDK Compatibility
- Issue: Hyperledger Fabric SDK v1.0.0 had compatibility issues
- Solution: Created Mock Fabric Client to simulate blockchain operations
- Status: Working perfectly with simulated blockchain

### 2. ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
- Issue: PostCSS configuration error with Tailwind v4
- Solution: Updated `postcss.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Status: Fixed and running

### 3. ✅ Database Setup
- Issue: Database user and schema setup
- Solution: PostgreSQL running in Docker with correct configuration
- Status: Database connected and working

   - User: `audit_user`
   - Password: `audit_password`

3. **Frontend**: React app with Tailwind CSS
   - Port: 3000
   - Hot reload enabled

4. **Backend**: Go API with Gin framework
   - Port: 8080 (API)
   - Port: 9090 (Metrics)
